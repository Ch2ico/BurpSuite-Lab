Lab #6 : Broken brute-force protection, multiple credentials per request

info:
    - a valid username 'carlos'
    - password list
    - There is a user rate limited, limiting the time between several requests

STEP 1: SCRAP The passwords
- Get a list of passwords on Web security website

STEP 2: Find a way to make several credential attempt in 1 HTTP request
We have to use Json format to make it
output: {"username": "carlos", "password": ["123456", "password", "123456789","111111", "1234567", "dragon"]}

STEP 3: Make a request with the Json Format
BAD Output: Internal Server Error
Solution : The error was in the request format
BAD request :  r = requests.post(url, json = json, verify=False, proxies=proxy )
GOOD request: r = requests.post(url, data = json, verify=False, proxies=proxy )
We don't need to format the Json data, it's already in the good format. Although it's good to make a request
to see the initial format of the request
[!] Stick to the methodology:
    - I can't guess the type of reqest format
    - Neither the technology used
    - Be methodologic and keep it simple as possible
